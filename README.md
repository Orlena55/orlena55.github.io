* Who I am?
  
I am a PhD student in Dr.Ofer Shoshani lab. I started my PhD a year ago and study biogenesis of Gene amplification in the development of cancer. 

* My home

  I am a French woman born in Paris. I lived half of my life in Toulouse, a city in the south of France called the "pink city" because the walls are pink/red in the sun.

* My research
  
In our lab, we study gene amplification and all types of genomic catastrophes that can induce the development of tumors. We are a relatively young lab, around 3 years old, if you want more information, you can visit our site:

* Python course
  
I chose to take the Python course for several reasons:
1. I have always had projects and wanted to implement them but as I don't know how to code I am limited.
1. I think this is a significant skill these days and which is rewarding when looking for a job.
1. Thank you Gabor for giving me the chance to participate in this course.
